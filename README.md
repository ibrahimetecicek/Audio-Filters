# Audio-recorder
Extract the attached folder to the desktop. There are 4 matlab files in it. Each matlab file records 3 seconds. Run Matlab and upload these files to matlab one by one. If you press F5 in the Editor tab, a note will appear on the screen, then continue by saying Change Directory then the programs will run and the Start Speaking command will appear to record the sound. After seeing this command, you can record audio for 3 seconds. You will then hear the End of Recording command and listen to your own voice. You can repeat as many times as you want if it is not properly recorded. If you record in a quiet environment, there will be less noise and a better result.
